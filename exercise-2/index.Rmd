## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Create some data 
Primates <- c('Potar monkey', 'Gorilla', 'Human', 'Rhesus monkey', 'Chimp') 
Bodywt <- c(10.0, 207.0, 62.0, 6.8, 52.2) 
Brainwt <- c(115, 406, 1320, 179, 440) 
data <- data.frame(Primates, Bodywt, Brainwt)
# Using plotly 
plot_ly(data, x = ~Bodywt, y = ~Brainwt, type = 'scatter',   
mode = 'text', text = ~Primates, textposition = 'middle right',       
textfont = list(color = '#000000', size = 16)) %>%      
layout(title = 'Primates Brain and Body Weight',      
xaxis = list(title = 'Body Weight (kg)', zeroline = TRUE,                
range = c(0, 250)), yaxis = list(title = 'Brain Weight (g)', range = c(0,1400)))

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
